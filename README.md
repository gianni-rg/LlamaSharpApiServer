## Contribution

The project is constantly evolving and contributions are warmly welcomed.

I'm more than happy to receive any kind of contribution to this experimental project: from helpful feedbacks to bug reports, documentation, usage examples, feature requests, or directly code contribution for bug fixes and new and/or improved features.

Feel free to file issues and pull requests on the repository and I'll address them as much as I can, *with a best effort approach during my spare time*.

> Development is mainly done on Windows, so other platforms are not directly developed, tested or supported.  
> An help is kindly appreciated in make the application work on other platforms as well.
